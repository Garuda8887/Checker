**Why such a high "Max threads per board" number?**  
4chan boards can have a large number of active threads, and some boards move very quickly. Setting a high maximum (like 1000) ensures that you can search through every active thread on a board without missing any potential matches. This is especially useful for comprehensive OSINT tasks or research where completeness is critical. If the number is set too low, you might miss newer or less active threads.

### 4. Progress Bars

Watch the progress as threads are searched and media is downloaded in parallel.
